# LLVM Build Infrastructure

[package.py](package.py) script automates downloading, building and packing of LLVM distribution used by Kotlin/Native.
### Requirements
* Check [LLVM requirements](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements). Note that:
    * Visual Studio 2017 is required on Windows
    * Xcode is required on macOS
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

### Usage

Just run
```
python3 package.py
```
It will create a `llvm-distribution` folder which contains LLVM distribution.  
Note that build will take a lot of time and all your machine cores. ðŸ˜ˆ  
See [HACKING.md](../../HACKING.md#using-different-llvm-distributions-as-part-of-kotlinnative-compilation-pipeline) on how to use freshly built distribution.

### Tuning
Run `python3 package.py -h` to check how one can tune script's behavior.
Some examples:
* `--archive-path` creates an archive (`zip` on Windows, `tar.gz` on macOS and Linux) with distribution
  alongside with its SHA256.
* `--install-path` allows overriding distribution's output directory.
* `--num-stages` specifies number of steps in build. Passing 2 or more makes bootstrap build which
  means that LLVM will build itself by using distribution from the previous step.
* `--stage0` allows using existing LLVM toolchain for bootstrapping.

### Known problems
1. Bootstrap build is not working on macOS for default git branch.
2. `libcxx` and `compiler-rt` are built as projects, not runtimes.
3. No way to run LLVM tests out of the box.
4. No way to override default `install` task out of the box.
